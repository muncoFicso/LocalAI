## Story
 
Resident Evil 6 follows four main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, a US government agent who witnesses a bioterrorist attack on the President; Chris Redfield, a former BSAA captain who suffers from amnesia after a failed mission; Jake Muller, a mercenary and son of Albert Wesker who has a unique blood type; and Ada Wong, a mysterious spy who is involved in the events behind the scenes. Each character has a partner who assists them in their missions: Helena Harper, Piers Nivans, Sherry Birkin and Agent respectively.
 
The game's story is divided into four campaigns that can be played in any order. Each campaign has five chapters that take place in different locations around the world, such as North America, Europe, China and Edonia. The campaigns intersect at certain points, allowing players to see different perspectives of the same events. The game also features a fifth campaign that is unlocked after completing the other four, which focuses on Ada Wong's role in the plot.
 
The main antagonist of the game is Derek C. Simmons, a high-ranking member of The Family, a secret organization that controls world affairs. He is responsible for unleashing the C-virus, a new strain of bioweapon that can mutate humans into various creatures called J'avo. He also has a personal vendetta against Leon and Ada, whom he considers traitors to his cause. He is aided by Carla Radames, a scientist who was experimented on by Simmons and became his loyal follower.
